						LEAD: 'About Gig Grafter',
						OVERVIEW: '<p>Welcome to <strong>Scheduler</strong> by Gig Grafter &#8212; <strong>Flexible Online Rota Software</strong></p><p>We&#39;re often asked what has motivated us to start Gig Grafter and the simple answer is frustration. Frustration at the lack of simple, efficient and <strong>affordable workforce management</strong> tools designed for <strong>smaller businesses</strong>. We were looking for something specifically created to assist <strong>employers to retain great staff</strong> through <strong>flexibility and fairness</strong> of <strong>shift allocations</strong> that is responsive to changing staff availability.</p><p>Our passion for developing technology to improve the competitiveness and productivity of small businesses stems from our direct experience as the founders of Nifty Nosh, an online takeaway food ordering service that was acquired bu Just Eat in 2015.</p><p><strong>Adaptive scheduling</strong> combined with <strong>reliable and efficient employee communications</strong> between management and staff were essential tools in ensuring that we could attract and retain high quality candidates to join our customer support team.</p><p>Through Gig Grafter we are using our experience and knowledge as employers of a highly <strong>flexible workforce</strong> to create <strong>employee scheduling solutions</strong> that can enable other employers to <strong>offer greater flexibility</strong> to their <strong>hourly paid staff</strong> as a means of <strong>attracting and retaining high quality employees</strong>.</p>',
